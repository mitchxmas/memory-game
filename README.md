## Overview

#### Game basics & technology used

- The game is a game of "Memory" or sometimes known as "Pairs" where the players need to find matching cards on the board.
- It uses a basic HTML page and all actions/functions originate in Javascript and Thru the DOM
- I decided to rely mainly on **DOM manipulation** and **JS array/objects** instead of HTML classes & CSS :
- All the deck of cards, all card actions, reshuffling & use of any wildcards is populated/driven from JS

#### General Approach

- I wanted to get an MVP up and running fast with minimal stretch goals and build upon that solid fundation
- Originally, the game only one level, and was working but was "plain vanilla" without any additional features
- I then pushed teh boundaries, made the game more personal by adding new features & buttons Wildcards (three in total), Reset, Help menu
- Stretch goals, in sequence:
- properly deploy three working game levels
- Introduce WildCard 1: a card that pinches cards from the opponent (no changes to the board, just changes the scores and impacts the HTML output)
- Introduce WildCard 2: a card that zeros the opponent's score and put all his cards back on the board (this required deep structural changes in the game structure)
- Introduce WildCard 3: a card that allows to reshuffle the board at any time (this further structural changes to the game structure)

### Unsolved problems

- Fortunately, there are no unsolved problems to date
- I would have liked to push the stretch goals further but risked not meeting the deadline
